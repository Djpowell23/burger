Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that allows the user to enter the name of any burger they wish to try. Once entered, that 
burger populates into the left column, waiting to be eaten. Burgers in the devoured column have a devour button. Once a burger 
is devoured, it moves to the right side where the customer has the option to make another one. All burgers and their devoured 
state are stored in a MYSQL database.
